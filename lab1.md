# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
This lab report establishes a detailed screenshot tutorial for logging into a CSE 15L course-specific account on `ieng6` through the following steps:
* [Finding Your CSE 15L Account](https://k3liang.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/lab1.html#step-0-finding-your-cse-15l-account)
* [Installing Visual Studio Code](https://k3liang.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/lab1.html#step-1-installing-visual-studio-code)
* [Remotely Connecting](https://k3liang.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/lab1.html#step-2-remotely-connecting)
* [Trying Some Commands](https://k3liang.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/lab1.html#step-3-trying-some-commands)

## Step 0: Finding Your CSE 15L Account
Of course, if you already have your CSE 15L account username and password set up, then you can skip to the [next step](https://k3liang.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/lab1.html#step-1-installing-visual-studio-code)!

If not, then you can find your course-specific account at <https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php>. Enter in your username and PID and you should see a page that shows your CSE 15L account:

* You should see your CSE 15L account username, which should start with `cs15l`. Copy that/Memorize for later use.
* We now need to reset your account password. Click on the button for your CSE 15L account
* Click on the hyperlink that says **Global Password Change Tool** and follow the onscreen instructions to reset your password.
* You should end on a message that says something like "Password change successful."
With that out of the way, we can move on to setting up our terminal!
## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code
Now the very first thing you need to do is download VScode at <https://code.visualstudio.com/> and follow the onscreen instructions if you don't already have VScode installed.
The opening screen should look something like this (maybe with different colors/themes):

I already had VScode installed from a prior class, so I didn't have to go through this beginning step.

Unfortunately, if you're on Windows like I am, you will also need to install `git` for Windows through <https://gitforwindows.org/>, following the onscreen instructions.  
After that, you can set the default VScode terminal to the newly installed `git bash` by following the steps in this post:  
[Setting Git Bash as Default Terminal For Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994)

We are now ready to ssh :)
## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
* If your VScode terminal isn't already open, you can open it through Ctrl or Command + ` like I did, or you can also click the Terminal option on the top menu bar, and then click on New Terminal
* 
## Step 3: Trying Some Commands
